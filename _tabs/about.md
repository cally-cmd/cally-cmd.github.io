## `whoami`

My greatest passion in life is _learning_ and applying what I have learned to solve problems.
The Computer Science and IT umbrella satisfies that passion perfectly, but I will dive down just about any rabbit hole.
One of best ways to both learn and apply the knowledge is to instruct others, so this blog fits in perfectly.

I am currently a System Engineer for \[redacted\], and my goal is to obtain the technical knowledge functionally equivalent to a director position in DFIR/SOC/GRC.
I have realized that CISO is quite likely not the role I wish to strive for or attain since I'm not interested in the politics that happen at that level.
It may be something that happens eventually regardless, but I am clearly unqualified for such a role anytime in the near to mid future.

Outside of cybersecurity and IT, I quite enjoy nature-- specifically birding, music, and reading.

## A Goofy Roadmap

> This is not a debate of certs vs. degrees, and I *cert*ainly know that applicable experience is important. Please do feel free to tell me modifications or that this is insanity =^.^=
